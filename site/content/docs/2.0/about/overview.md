## Team

{{< ourname >}} is maintained by the [Arizona Digital team](https://github.com/orgs/az-digital/people) on GitHub. We're always looking to grow this team and would love to hear from you if you're excited about CSS at scale, writing and maintaining vanilla JavaScript plugins, and improving build tooling processes for frontend code.

## History

{{< ourname >}} (**based on Bootstrap version 4**) is a major rewrite of UA Bootstrap (**based on Bootstrap version 3**).

UA Bootstrap was originally created by the [UA Digital team](https://bitbucket.org/uadigital/profile/members) in late 2014.
