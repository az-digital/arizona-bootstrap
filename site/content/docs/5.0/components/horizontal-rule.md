## About

A **horizontal rule** is a component useful for separating content or adding a simple accent to your content.

## Example

Simply add the `<hr>` tag to your content to add the horizontal rule.

{{< example >}}
<div class="bd-example">
	<p>This is a paragraph that I want to separate from the paragraph below.</p>
	<hr>
	<p>This is the other paragraph, which is separate from the one above.</p>
</div>
{{< /example >}}
