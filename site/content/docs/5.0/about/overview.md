## Team

{{< ourname >}} is maintained by the Arizona Digital team on GitHub. We're always looking to grow this team and would love to hear from you if you're excited about CSS at scale, writing and maintaining vanilla JavaScript plugins, and improving build tooling processes for front-end code.

## History

UA Bootstrap was originally created by the UA Digital team in late 2014. UA Bootstrap (based on Bootstrap version 3) was replaced by Arizona Bootstrap 2 (based on Bootstrap version 4) in 2020.

Arizona Bootstrap 5 (based on Bootstrap version 5) was released in July 2025.

## Get Involved

See the [Get Involved page]({{< docsref "/about/get-involved" >}}) to learn how to join our discussions in Slack, join our weekly Arizona Digital meetings, and contribute directly to the development of Arizona Bootstrap.
