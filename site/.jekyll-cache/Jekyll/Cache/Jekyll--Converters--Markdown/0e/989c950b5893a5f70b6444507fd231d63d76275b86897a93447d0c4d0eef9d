<p>Assistive technologies such as screen readers will have trouble with your forms if you donâ€™t include a label for every input. For these inline forms, you can hide the labels using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">.sr-only</code> class. There are further alternative methods of providing a label for assistive technologies, such as the <code class="highlighter-rouge">aria-label</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">aria-labelledby</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">title</code> attribute. If none of these are present, assistive technologies may resort to using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">placeholder</code> attribute, if present, but note that use of <code class="highlighter-rouge">placeholder</code> as a replacement for other labelling methods is not advised.</p>
