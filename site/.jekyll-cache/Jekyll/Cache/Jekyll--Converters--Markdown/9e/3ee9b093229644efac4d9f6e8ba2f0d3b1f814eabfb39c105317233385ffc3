<p>In order for assistive technologies (such as screen readers) to convey that a series of buttons is grouped, an appropriate <code class="highlighter-rouge">role</code> attribute needs to be provided. For button groups, this would be <code class="highlighter-rouge">role="group"</code>, while toolbars should have a <code class="highlighter-rouge">role="toolbar"</code>.</p>

<p>In addition, groups and toolbars should be given an explicit label, as most assistive technologies will otherwise not announce them, despite the presence of the correct role attribute. In the examples provided here, we use <code class="highlighter-rouge">aria-label</code>, but alternatives such as <code class="highlighter-rouge">aria-labelledby</code> can also be used.</p>
