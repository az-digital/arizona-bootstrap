<h5 id="link-functionality-caveat">Link Functionality Caveat</h5>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">.disabled</code> class uses <code class="highlighter-rouge">pointer-events: none</code> to try to disable the link functionality of <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;a&gt;</code>s, but that CSS property is not yet standardized. In addition, even in browsers that do support <code class="highlighter-rouge">pointer-events: none</code>, keyboard navigation remains unaffected, meaning that sighted keyboard users and users of assistive technologies will still be able to activate these links. So to be safe, add a <code class="highlighter-rouge">tabindex="-1"</code> attribute on these links (to prevent them from receiving keyboard focus) and use custom JavaScript to disable their functionality.</p>
