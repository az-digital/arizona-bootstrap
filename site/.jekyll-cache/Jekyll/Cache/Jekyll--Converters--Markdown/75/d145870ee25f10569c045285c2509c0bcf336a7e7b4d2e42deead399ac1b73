<p>To allow keyboard users to activate your popovers, you should only add them to HTML elements that are traditionally keyboard-focusable and interactive (such as links or form controls). Although arbitrary HTML elements (such as <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;span&gt;</code>s) can be made focusable by adding the <code class="highlighter-rouge">tabindex="0"</code> attribute, this will add potentially annoying and confusing tab stops on non-interactive elements for keyboard users, and most assistive technologies currently do not announce the popover’s content in this situation. Additionally, do not rely solely on <code class="highlighter-rouge">hover</code> as the trigger for your popovers, as this will make them impossible to trigger for keyboard users.</p>

<p>While you can insert rich, structured HTML in popovers with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">html</code> option, we strongly recommend that you avoid adding an excessive amount of content. The way popovers currently work is that, once displayed, their content is tied to the trigger element with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">aria-describedby</code> attribute. As a result, the entirety of the popover’s content will be announced to assistive technology users as one long, uninterrupted stream.</p>

<p>Additionally, while it is possible to also include interactive controls (such as form elements or links) in your popover (by adding these elements to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">whiteList</code> or allowed attributes and tags), be aware that currently the popover does not manage keyboard focus order. When a keyboard user opens a popover, focus remains on the triggering element, and as the popover usually does not immediately follow the trigger in the document’s structure, there is no guarantee that moving forward/pressing <kbd>TAB</kbd> will move a keyboard user into the popover itself. In short, simply adding interactive controls to a popover is likely to make these controls unreachable/unusable for keyboard users and users of assistive technologies, or at the very least make for an illogical overall focus order. In these cases, consider using a modal dialog instead.</p>
