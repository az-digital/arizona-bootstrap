# Arizona Bootstrap

Build responsive, mobile-first projects on the web with the University of Arizona's theme for Bootstrap 4.

Bootstrap is an open source toolkit for developing with HTML, CSS, and JS. Quickly prototype your ideas or build your entire app with our Sass variables and mixins, responsive grid system, extensive prebuilt components, and powerful plugins built on jQuery.

A team of web-focused volunteers known as Arizona Digital meets weekly to build and test products like Arizona Bootstrap and Arizona Quickstart. Contributions are what keep Arizona Bootstrap moving and improving, and are in everyone's best interest.
